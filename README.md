# Welcome!

Hi,

My name is Jordan Hearty.  I am currently learning to code in Java and hope to learn some new coding techniques in different languages along the way.

I enjoy graphic design, web design, coding and am a self-taught guitarist

I aspire to be a gain a career in Software Engineering and have applied to Kainos' excellent <i>Earn As You Learn</i> initiative based in Northern Ireland! 

Please see my work linked below, or click around my repositories

<b>1. Celcius to Fahrenheit Converter:</b>
https://github.com/jordan-hearty/Java-Exercises/tree/master/Temperature/src/temperature
A simple converter which converts the value in Celcius, to it's Fahrenheit value.

<b>2. Boiling & Freezing</b> https://github.com/jordan-hearty/Java-Exercises/blob/master/BoilingAndFreezing/src/boiling/BoilingAndFreezing.java
Shows my knowledge of using IF statements and ELSE IF to return an answer to the user. This simple piece of code takes the users value, interprets it and returns a value to say if the water is at boiling point, in a normal state, or freezing.
